# cubevolution
A light weight evolution simulation in unity using C# and Unity. The C# files in the repository lay out the rules for the simulation: cubes will die if they dont get enough food, every time a cube gains food it grows larger and faster (therfore increasing its ability to get more food) and once all the food is gone bigger cubes begin to eat smaller cubes. 

This three simple rules mimic natural selecion. The next two objectives on this project are to introduce reproduction (so evolution over more then one generation can be displayed) and introduce a UI so the user can tweak paramter like random starting locations, food stress and each cube's sight ability.
